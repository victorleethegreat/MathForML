### Linear Algebra

* Coursera: Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science
  
  * **System of Linear Equations: 2 Variables**
    
    * sentences to equations 
    
    * difference between a complete system and a redundant system 
    
    * non-singular versus singular 
    
    * a complete or non-singular system carry as many pieces of information as the sentences
    
    * a complete or non-singular system of equestions yield a unique solution 
    
    * a singular system of questions yield infinite or no solution
    
    * linear algebra: the study of linear equations 
    
    * from a geometric aspect, a non-singular system of equations yield a unique solution 
    
    * a geometric notion of singularity: combine both redundant & contradictory into just one form of singularity by setting the constants to zero 
    
    * a singular system equation can be defined through the value of dependant
      
      * a system of equations is singular if the value of dependant is zero 
      
      * a system of equations is non-singular if the value of dependant is non-zero
  
  * **System of Linear Equations: 2 Variables**
    
    * TODO
